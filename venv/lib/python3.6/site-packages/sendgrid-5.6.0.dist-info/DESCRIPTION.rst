**NEW:**

-  Subscribe to email
   `notifications <https://dx.sendgrid.com/newsletter/python>`__ for
   releases and breaking changes.
-  Quickly get started with
   `Docker <https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/tree/master/docker>`__.

**This library allows you to quickly and easily use the SendGrid Web API
v3 via Python.**

Version 3.X.X+ of this library provides full support for all SendGrid
`Web API
v3 <https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html>`__
endpoints, including the new `v3
/mail/send <https://sendgrid.com/blog/introducing-v3mailsend-sendgrids-new-mail-endpoint>`__.

This library represents the beginning of a new path for SendGrid. We
want this library to be community driven and SendGrid led. We need your
help to realize this goal. To help make sure we are building the right
things in the right order, we ask that you create
`issues <https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/issues>`__ and
`pull
requests <https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__
or simply upvote or comment on existing issues or pull requests.

Please browse the rest of this README for further detail.

We appreciate your continued support, thank you!

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Python version 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 or 3.6
-  The SendGrid service, starting at the `free
   level <https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-python>`__

Setup Environment Variables
---------------------------

Mac
~~~

Update the development environment with your
`SENDGRID\_API\_KEY <https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys>`__
(more info
`here <https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/api_keys.html>`__),
for example:

.. code:: bash

    echo "export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'" > sendgrid.env
    echo "sendgrid.env" >> .gitignore
    source ./sendgrid.env

Sendgrid also supports local environment file ``.env``. Copy or rename
``.env_sample`` into ``.env`` and update
`SENDGRID\_API\_KEY <https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys>`__ with
your key.

Windows
~~~~~~~

Temporarily set the environment variable(accesible only during the
current cli session):

.. code:: bash

    set SENDGRID_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

Permanently set the environment variable(accessible in all subsequent
cli sessions):

.. code:: bash

    setx SENDGRID_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY"

Install Package
---------------

.. code:: bash

    pip install sendgrid

Dependencies
------------

-  `Python-HTTP-Client <https://github.com/sendgrid/python-http-client>`__

 # Quick Start

Hello Email
-----------

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email with the
`/mail/send
Helper <https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/tree/master/sendgrid/helpers/mail>`__
(`here <https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/blob/master/examples/helpers/mail/mail_example.py#L20>`__
is a full example):

With Mail Helper Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    import sendgrid
    import os
    from sendgrid.helpers.mail import *

    sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(apikey=os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY'))
    from_email = Email("test@example.com")
    to_email = Email("test@example.com")
    subject = "Sending with SendGrid is Fun"
    content = Content("text/plain", "and easy to do anywhere, even with Python")
    mail = Mail(from_email, subject, to_email, content)
    response = sg.client.mail.send.post(request_body=mail.get())
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.body)
    print(response.headers)

The ``Mail`` constructor creates a `personalization
object <https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/personalizations.html>`__
for you.
`Here <https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/blob/master/examples/helpers/mail/mail_example.py#L16>`__
is an example of how to add it.

Without Mail Helper Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email without the
/mail/send Helper
(`here <https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/blob/master/examples/mail/mail.py#L27>`__
is a full example):

.. code:: python

    import sendgrid
    import os

    sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(apikey=os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY'))
    data = {
      "personalizations": [
        {
          "to": [
            {
              "email": "test@example.com"
            }
          ],
          "subject": "Sending with SendGrid is Fun"
        }
      ],
      "from": {
        "email": "test@example.com"
      },
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text/plain",
          "value": "and easy to do anywhere, even with Python"
        }
      ]
    }
    response = sg.client.mail.send.post(request_body=data)
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.body)
    print(response.headers)

General v3 Web API Usage (With `Fluent Interface <https://sendgrid.com/blog/using-python-to-implement-a-fluent-interface-to-any-rest-api/>`__)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

    import sendgrid
    import os

    sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(apikey=os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY'))
    response = sg.client.suppression.bounces.get()
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.body)
    print(response.headers)

General v3 Web API Usage (Without Fluent Interface)
---------------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

    import sendgrid
    import os

    sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(apikey=os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY'))
    response = sg.client._("suppression/bounces").get()
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.body)
    print(response.headers)
