Public gatherings, as massive as Kumbh Mela, might receive a lot of cancellations and delays of flights. Therefore, we aim to automate the process of the compensation provided to the passengers when flights are delayed/canceled, by levaraging the power of smart contracts. Then the passengers donâ€™t need to stand in long queues to claim their meal, hotel or taxi vouchers. As soon as the tracking system sends the details the contract gets triggered and issues the vouchers.

## Future Scope

* Provide the airlines with the API so that they can drive the passenger experience.
* Integrate a chat-bot with the existing API so that the service can be more interactive for the user.
* User can choose their preferences such as class, time filtering.
